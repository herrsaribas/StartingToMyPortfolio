# StartingToMyPortfolio

Practice Day

- Using pencil and paper sketch a responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Pick a color palette for your project (https://coolors.co/).
- On Github create your repo, and clone it locally.
- Take a picture of your sketches and push them to your repo by max 10:30.
- IMPORTANT: By 10:45 you should start coding your project.
- Go mobile first ( in case you need media queries use the min-width approach ).
- Only use the techniques covered in class.
- It's easy to get carried away by fancy designs. Stay focused on the structure instead.
- Publish your project on github pages
